## Challenge 2: teams, teams, teams. ðŸ›¸

Our application will have a model <code>Team</code>. The team should have a 'name' field, and a field called 'participants' that will store an array of User ids.

Create the routes and views necessary to:
- Create a new team. All the users should be placed in a <code>select</code>. You should be able to choose *multiple* users as participants.
- See all the teams (list of names with anchors to their detail)
- See the team detail with team name and detailed information of each one of the participants
- Edit team
- Delete team

Create a new team with your real team name and the three real users as participants.

Then, come and show the code for validation to get the NEXT CLUE OF THE CHALLENGE.
